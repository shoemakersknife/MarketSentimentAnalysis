# Rough Pipeline for Comparing Stock Movements with Sentiment Analysis
**Applied full ML lifecycle**: preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation/analysis

-Calculated Reddit sentiment using a transformer-based, deep learning model fine-tuned for understanding financial language (FinBERT). Developed end-to-end Natural Language Processing pipeline for efficient sentiment analysis.

-Utilized Python ecosystem: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

-Reddit API Setup: Bot scraping reddit posts from r/investing, r/stocks, r/wallstreetbets.

-Text normalization, tokenization, stopword removal to filter out noise -> sentiment score (positive/negative/neutral <=> -1, 0, 1)

-Measured sentiment over certain time period over large data sets. Merged sentiment data with stock data and visualized potential trends.

-Used Jupyter Notebooks and gained experience with tech stacks.
