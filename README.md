# Comparing Stock Movements with Sentiment Analysis
**Applied full ML lifecycle**: preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation/analysis

-Analyzed Reddit sentiment using FinBERT (PyTorch-based neural network) and developed end-to-end Natural Language Processing pipeline for sentiment analysis. 
-Python ecosystem: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
-Reddit API Setup: Bot scraping reddit posts from r/investing, r/stocks, r/wallstreetbets.
-Text normalization, tokenization, stopword removal to filter out noise -> sentiment score (positive/negative/neutral <=> -1, 0, 1)
-Measured sentiment over certain time period over large data sets. Merged sentiment data with stock data and visualized potential trends. Documented using Jupyter Notebooks. Experience with tech stacks.
